# ðŸ”§ Linux Service Auto-Restart Script

This is a simple Bash script that checks if a given **systemd** service is running on a Linux system. If the service is down, it automatically attempts to restart it.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Checks if a specified systemd service is active
- Automatically starts the service if it's not running
- Lightweight and easy to use
- Can be used manually or automated with cron

---

## ðŸ“œ Usage

### 1. Make the script executable:

chmod +x service_check.bash
Run the script with a service name:
./service_check.bash ssh
You can replace ssh with any other service like nginx, apache2, cron, etc.
ðŸ§ª Example Output
ssh is down, starting again
If the service is already running, the script will not output anything.

ðŸ•’ Automate with Cron (Optional)

To check the service every 5 minutes, add this line to your crontab:

*/5 * * * * /path/to/service_check.bash ssh
